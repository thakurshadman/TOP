    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup oil or ghee
        </li>
        <li>500g lamb or mutton, bone in preferably
        </li>
        <li>600g tomatoes, finely chopped or pureed</li>
        <li> 1 bulb garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 thumb sized chunk of ginger, minced
        </li>
        <li>2 tsp salt, or to taste
        </li>
        <li>2 tsp paprika or kashmiri red chilli powder
        </li>
        <li>1.5 tsp black pepper
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp chilli flakes
        </li>
        <li>0.5 tsp cumin powder
        </li>
        <li>0.5 tsp coriander powder
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp onion seeds (kalonji, optional)
        </li>
        <li>2 green chillis, slit in half if you like your Karahi hot
        </li>
        <li>0.5 bunch coriander, chopped
        </li>
        <li>Ginger cut into matchsticks, as much as desired</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up your oil/ghee in a wok, cast iron skillet or karahi. Add the lamb/mutton and fry on high, stirring constantly until all the meat has changed its colour</li>
        <li>Add the minced ginger and garlic and give this a quick fry, until the raw smell goes away. Don't allow the ginger and garlic to colour too much</li>
        <li>Add all the spices and 1/1.5 cups of water for lamb and 2.5/3 cups of water for mutton. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to low and put to lid on. Simmer for 1hr for lamb and 2hrs for mutton. Keep checking during this time to ensure there is sufficient water and top up a little as and if required</li>
        <li>Once the simmer time is up, the meat should be 80% done and there shouldn't be much water in the pan. The pan will look quite oily (remember, you can remove the oil at the end if you want!)</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to high. Add the tomatoes. Let this cook on high, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan. The tomatoes will release A LOT of moisture. Keep stirring and just allow everything to concentrate</li>
        <li>Once the gravy (masala) looks wet but almost done and the oil is beginning to come to the surface, add in the chopped coriander and green chilli. Turn the heat to low and allow this to simmer without the lid on for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Garnish with additional chopped coriander and the matchstick-cut ginger</li>
    </ol>
